                   draft-ietf-core-target-attr-latest

Abstract

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply Web
   technologies to constrained environments.  One important such
   technology is Web Linking (RFC 8288), which CoRE specifications use
   as the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the Link
   Format (RFC 6690) in CoAP's Resource Discovery Protocol (Section 7.2
   of RFC7252) and the Resource Directory (RD, RFC 9176).

   Web Links can have target attributes, the names of which are not
   generally coordinated by the Web Linking specification (Section 2.2
   of RFC 8288).  This document introduces an IANA registry for
   coordinating names of target attributes when used in CoRE.  It
   updates the RD Parameters IANA Registry created by RFC 9176 to
   coordinate with this registry.

Internet-Draft       CoRE Target Attributes Registry        October 2023


1.  Introduction

   The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) specifications apply Web
   technologies to constrained environments.  One important such
   technology is Web Linking [RFC8288], which CoRE specifications use as
   the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the Link
   Format [RFC6690] in CoAP's Resource Discovery Protocol (Section 7.2
   of [RFC7252]) and the Resource Directory [RFC9176].

   Web Links can have target attributes.  The original Web Linking
   specification (Section 3 of [RFC5988]) did not attempt to coordinate
   names of target attributes except for providing common target
   attributes for use in the Link HTTP header.  The current revision of
   that specification clarifies (Section 2.2 of [RFC8288]):

   |  This specification does not attempt to coordinate the name of
   |  target attributes, their cardinality, or use.  Those creating and
   |  maintaining serialisations SHOULD coordinate their target
   |  attributes to avoid conflicts in semantics or syntax and MAY
   |  define their own registries of target attributes.

   This document introduces an IANA registry for coordinating names of
   target attributes when used in CoRE, with specific instructions for
   the Designated Expert for this registry (Section 2.1).  It updates
   the RD Parameters IANA Registry created by [RFC9176] to coordinate
   with this registry.

   With a registry now available, registration of target attributes is
   strongly encouraged.  The incentive is that an unregistered attribute
   name might be registered with a different meaning at any time.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  IANA Considerations

   This specification creates a new Target Attributes registry in the
   "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry group
   [IANA.core-parameters], with the policy "Expert Review" (Section 4.5
   of [BCP26]).

2.1.  Instructions for the Designated Expert

   The expert is requested to guide the registrant towards reasonably
   short target attribute names where the shortness will help conserve
   resources in constrained systems, but also to be frugal in the
   allocation of very short names, keeping them in reserve for
   applications that are likely to enjoy wide use and can make good use
   of their shortness.

   The expert is also instructed to direct the registrant to provide a
   specification (Section 4.6 of [BCP26]), but can make exceptions, for
   instance when a specification is not available at the time of
   registration but is likely forthcoming.

   Any questions or issues that might interest a wider audience might be
   raised by the expert on the core-parameters@ietf.org mailing list for
   a time-limited discussion.  This might include security
   considerations, or opportunities for orchestration, e.g., when
   different names with similar intent are being or could be registered.

   If the expert becomes aware of target attributes that are deployed
   and in use, they may also initiate a registration on their own if
   they deem such a registration can avert potential future collisions.

2.2.  Structure of Entries

   Each entry in the registry must include:

   Attribute Name:
      a lower case ASCII [STD80] string that starts with a letter and
      can contain digits and hyphen-minus characters afterward
      ([a-z][-a-z0-9]*).  (Note that [RFC8288] requires target attribute
      names to be interpreted in a case-insensitive way; the restriction
      to lower case here ensures that they are registered in a
      predictable form).

   Brief description:
      a brief description

   Change Controller:
      see Section 2.3 of [BCP26]

   Reference:
      a reference document that provides a description of the target
      attribute, including the semantics for when the target attribute
      appears more than once in a link.

        Table 1: Initial Entries in the Target Attributes Registry

   A number of names are reserved as they are used for parameters in
   links other than target attributes.  A further set of target
   attributes is predefined in [RFC8288] and is imported into this
   registry.

   Section 9.3 of [RFC9176] created the "RD Parameters" IANA registry.
   This document requests IANA to add the following note to that
   registry:

      Note: In accordance with [this document], all entries with the "A"
      flag set, including new ones, MUST also be registered in the
      "Target Attributes" registry [IANA.core-parameters].

3.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC8288] apply, as do those of the
   discovery specifications [RFC6690], [RFC7252], and [RFC9176].

Acknowledgements

   The CoRE WG had been discussing setting up a registry for target
   attributes since the final touches were made on [RFC6690].  The
   update of the Web Linking specification to [RFC8288] provided the
   formal setting, but it took until Jaime Jiménez provided the set of
   initial registrations to generate a first version of this
   specification.  The current version addresses additional input and
   working group last call comments by Esko Dijk, Marco Tiloca, Thomas
   Fossati, and Mohamed Boucadair, as well as area director review
   comments from Rob Wilton.
